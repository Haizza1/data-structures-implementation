"""Design a food ordering system where your python program will run two threads,

 + Place Order: This thread will be placing an order and inserting that into a queue. This thread places new order
 + every 0.5 second. (hint: use time.sleep(0.5) function)

 + Serve Order: This thread will server the order. All you need to do is pop the order out of the queue and print it. 
 +This thread serves an order every 2 seconds. Also start this thread 1 second after place order thread is started."""
